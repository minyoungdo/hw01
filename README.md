Hey, this is Minyoung, and I have the cutest dog in the world.

# __*My name is Minyoung Do* Nice to meet you!__

I am from Seoul, South Korea. Before this program, I went to the University of Minnesota for 2 years and worked at a local non-profit for a year after graduating from college. I am so excited to learn more computational skills as well as meeting new people. 



* Fun facts about myself
  * I hate my nose bridge being touched.
  * My dog can *steal* cookies and things from my mouth, and I enjoy it.
  * My worst nightmare would be being stuck in a room full of statues, especially _Egyptian_ ones.

Hey, this is Minyoung, and I have the cutest dog in the world.

### *My name is __Minyoung Do__* 
#### Nice to meet you!


I am from Seoul, South Korea. Before this program, I worked at a local non-profit for a year after graduating from the University of Minnesota. I am so excited to learn more computational skills, meet new people, and try all the good restaurants in Chi-town!



* Fun facts about myself
  * I hate my nose bridge being touched.
  * My dog can *steal* cookies and things from my mouth, and I enjoy it.
  * My worst nightmare would be being stuck in a room full of statues, especially _Egyptian_ ones.
  
### Me Being Way Too Excited to Give Drake a Bath

Honestly, how can you not be excited to give him a bath, look at him, he's so cute. I just want to go home asap so that I can cuddle him FOREVER.

__Another fun fact__ People tell me they can't tell if I am drunk or not because I am always hyper. #too_much_information

Am I petting my dog, or is *he* petting me?!
